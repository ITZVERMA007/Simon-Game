ðŸŽ® Simon Game
Hello and welcome!

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Simon Game, developed as part of my learning journey in web development. It helped me gain practical experience in working with JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and handling user interaction.

As one of my early projects, it reflects my commitment to continuously learning and growing as a developer.

Feel free to explore the game â€” I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed building it!

ðŸŽ¯ How to Play
Press any key to start the game.

A sequence of colors will be displayed â€” remember the order!

Repeat the sequence by clicking the colored buttons in the correct order.

With each level, the sequence gets longer.

Make a mistake? The game resets, and you can try again!
